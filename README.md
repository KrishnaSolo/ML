# This repo contains my progression in the world of ML and Deep Learning
Please feel free to use any of the code in the repo to learn or build your own projects
Please do not copy any code from a1,a2 or a3 files as they are Uoft owned assignments I wrote.

a1 - 3 sections: 1st focusing on Linear Regression, 2nd on Logistic Regression, 3rd on Batch Gradient vs SGD and ADAM
     All 3 models were trained on the two class notMNIST dataset - all findings are in our report

a2 - 2 sections: 1st designing a Neural Network using Numpy, 2nd designing a Neural Network using tensorflow
     Models were trained on 10 class notMNIST dataset - only part2 was completed due to some unfortunate circumstances

a3 - 2 sections: 1st implementing a varient of K-means, 2nd implementing Mixtures of Gaussian(MOG) model
     Models were trained on 2-dimensional dataset and 100-dimensional dataset - all findings are in our report
